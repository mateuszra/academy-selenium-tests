# Selenium Example
This is a very simple example of a Selenium JUnit framework

To run tests:
`mvn clean test`

Tasks:
1. Add descriptive message to the assertion
2. Get the test to pass
3. Update the tests to use your own names or some other names of your choice
4. Make sure both first and last name is correctly typed in
5. Assert that the following string appears on Receipt after submission `You are now subscribed to our service.`
6. Try find the elements using locators other than ID, for example: CSS, Class Name, XPATH
7. Try to run the tests from a different browser eg. Firefox
8. Extend the test to test address and zipcode too
9. Verify that the default placeholder value in the UI is there for First name, last name, address and zip code
